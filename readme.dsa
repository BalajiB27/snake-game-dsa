# üêç Snake Game Using DSA

This project is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C++ using data structures and algorithms. It uses arrays or linked lists to represent the snake's body and logic for movement, collision detection, and food generation.

## üí° Key Concepts Used:
- Arrays / Linked Lists for snake body
- Collision detection logic
- Real-time key event handling
- Dynamic memory allocation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Used:
- C++
- Console Graphics
- DSA Concepts

## üìö Learning Outcome:
This project helps in understanding DSA concepts like:
- Memory handling
- Real-time updates
- Queue behavior of snake growth

## üöÄ How to Run:
Compile the `snake.cpp` file in a C++ environment that supports real-time inputs.
