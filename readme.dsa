 Snake Game Using DSA

This project is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C++ using data structures and algorithms. It uses arrays or linked lists to represent the snake's body and logic for movement, collision detection, and food generation.

## Key Concepts Used:
- Arrays / Linked Lists for snake body
- Collision detection logic
- Real-time key event handling
- Dynamic memory allocation

## Tech Used:
- C++
- Console Graphics
- DSA Concepts

##  Learning Outcome:
This project helps in understanding DSA concepts like:
- Memory handling
- Real-time updates
- Queue behavior of snake growth
